\chapter{Results}

Not really sure about the subsections here (I still don't understand the texture options).

The idea that currently comes to mind: For each parameter setting, create a record containing the following: 

- performance (time)

- average accuracy (targetRGB-latticeRGB)

- maxDifference (the important quantity)

- maybe other stuff (e.g. number of optimizer rounds)

Also mention that it is multi-threaded and performance is not really a priority - the cube has to be created only once and then can be reused as much as the artists need.

Compare these records with regard to:

\subsection{Choice ot threshold}

E.g. which threshold is still good enough for the moment method, the performance etc.

\subsection{Sigmoid vs Moment method}

Compare these two approaches (the texture option which I'm not sure about), choose the same threshold for both of them, maybe do this for more thresholds?

\subsection{Constrained input}

Compare maybe the performance of different atlases, or maybe atlas vs. seeding from the middle?

The Results chapter is just a sketch and it may be completely changed, depending on the results and which of them will be interesting.
