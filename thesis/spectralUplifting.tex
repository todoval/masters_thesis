\chapter{Spectral Uplifting}

Maybe add a sections as an intro? Depending on the text

\section{Available methods}

(with regard to reflectance spectra)
Maybe separate them into subsections, or add a subsection for comparing the results

\section{Trigonometric moment method}

\subsection{Evaluation of various parameters}

\subsection{Reconstruction results}
