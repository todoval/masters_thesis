\chapter{Color Science}

Introduction to colors - what is a color, multiple ways of representing colors (tristimulus, spectral)

\section{Spectral color representation}
What a spectrum is from the POV of physics, wavelengths, sampling of spectra, visible wavelengths, human perception of spectrum, metamerism

Mention reflectance/emission spectra

\section{Tristimulus representation}
We want to represent color by fewer values (impossible to store the complete spectrum)

RGB, LAB, CIE XYZ spaces, focusing on the RGB representation, conversions, matching functions etc.

\section{Rendering}
RGB vs Spectral renderers, their pros\&cons, examples
