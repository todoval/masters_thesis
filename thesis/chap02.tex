\section{Borgtool}

Mention what it does, how it works, what was it missing (constrained spectral uplifting)

\subsection{Optimizer}
Maybe the optimizer could be mentioned before in the cube contraints section, or it can have a special section?

\subsection{Choice of parameters}

Color atlases that might be provided, if not then the cube is seeded from the middle (use Munsell N5), mention how it is seeded
